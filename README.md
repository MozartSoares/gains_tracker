# ðŸŽ“ BYUâ€‘Idaho Final Project â€“ WDD330 & CSE340

This project was created to fulfill the final requirements of two BYUâ€‘Idaho courses:

- **CSE340 â€“ Web Backend Development**  
- **WDD330 â€“ Web Frontend Development**

For the backend (CSE340), I built a simple REST API using Fastify and TypeScript.  
For the frontend (WDD330), I created a basic interface using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Instead of building two separate projects, I decided to combine both into one fullstack application.  
The result is a lightweight, functional app that demonstrates how a simple frontend can interact with a custom backend API.

This approach allowed me to reinforce both backend and frontend concepts in a single, cohesive project.
